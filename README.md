# No-Thanks
An algorithm to play the game [No Thanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Thanks!_(game))!

It can only handle up to four players, since beyond that isn't super interesting, and it gets hard to display nicely.

This project uses a bit more Linq, and is my first attempt at using prefabs (just for something minor, but still).
